Convex optimization problems are a uniquitous class of problems that finds application in wide variety of fields. Some examples of it's real world applications inlucde automatic onctrol systems, estimation, and signal processing, electronics circuit design, statistics, finance, and data science. Compared to the nonconvex counterparts, the convex optimization problems has the distinct advantages of being reliable, efficient, almost always having a computer aided solution, the dual problem, and having special methods such as interior point methods for solving. The one of the biggest advantage of framing or even sometimes approximating a problem as convex optimization is the presence and accessibility of a global minimum. 

Optimization problems are typically characterized by an objective functions and constraints. Linear programming is optimization problems where objective and constraints are linear. Similarly, convex optimization problems are defined as optimization problems where the objective function and constraints are both convex.
