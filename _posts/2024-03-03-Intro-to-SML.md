# Why SML is important?
The world of artifical intelligence is fast evolving. Machine Learning (ML) has been a buzz word for quiet some time now. 
However, many people practioners of ML as well as potential employers of ML techniques are sometimes hesitant to apply ML especially when the results are not exactly reproducible.
Statistical machine learning (SML) concerns with the providing guarantees to various ML technique that could very from a simple linear regression to complex deep learning architectures.
This post focuses on introducing simple concepts that helps in basic understanding of these concepts.
