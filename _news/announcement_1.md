Our paper titled "Deep-Neural Network based Full System State Estimation Considering Practical Implementation Challenges" has been published in the Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy (MPCE). This paper introduces the Deep Neural Network based State Estimator (DeNSE) for accurately estimating the states while adressing the PMU non-observability issues at lower voltage levels of transmission systems. The paper can be accessed from https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10495872.
