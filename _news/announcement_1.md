Our paper titled "Time-Synchronized Full System State Estimation Considering Practical Implementation Challenges" has been accepted for publications on Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy (MPCE). This paper introduces a deep neural network based solution for accurately estimating the states while adressing the PMU non-observability issues at lower voltage levels of transmission systems. The Arxiv version of the paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01729.
