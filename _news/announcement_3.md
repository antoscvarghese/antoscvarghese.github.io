Our paper titled "Transmission Line Parameter Estimation Under Non-Gaussian Measurement Noise" is available now in IEEE Xplore. The paper tackles the challenge of non-Gaussian measurement noise in PMU measurements, when it is used for transmission line parameter estimation (TLPE). The paper introduces a novel highly accurate method named EGLE that could estimate parameters irrespective of the distribution of the PMU measurement noise (Gaussian/ Non-Gaussian). The core of the EGLE algorithm lies in the observation that for non-Gaussian measurement environments, minimizing the sum of squares of standardized errors (SSSE) is required for optimally estimating parameters of a linear system where as minimizing the sum of squares of errors (SSE) is sufficient in a Gaussian noise environment. The non-Gaussian noise is modeled as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). An added challenge for this problem is that the noise characteristics of the GMM noise is also unknown. To overcome this, a joint noise and parameter estimation approach (EGLE) is proposed based on the MLE principles. The robustness of the method is demonstrated by testing on various conditions. The proposed EGLE method is applicable to any linear system.
