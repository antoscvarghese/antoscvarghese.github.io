A paper co-authored by me, titled "Comparative Analysis of Information Theoretic and Statistical Methods for Line Parameter Estimation" has been accepted in the Conference on Smart Grid and Synchronized Measurements for Analytics (SGSMA). This paper does a comparitive study of information theoretic learning based methods such as minimizing the total error entropy (MTEE), maximizing the total correntropy (MTC) and the EGLE method for transmission line parameter estimation (TLPE). The paper describes advantages and disadvanteages of each methods in terms of estimation accuracy, tuning of parameters, and robustness against different types of measurement noise.
